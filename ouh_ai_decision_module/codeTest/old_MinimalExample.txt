The values are "internal name", "output name", "[ r,g,b]", and "order". The internal name is the structure name delivered if not changed in this config file. "output name" is the name the user would like as output. The "[r,g,b]" is the colours red, green, and blue and will take integer values in the range 0-255. "Order" will reflect the ordering of the structures in the RT-struct output file (values are unique integers starting from one and increasing by one for each struct config line)
